#Using ls can lead to finding "inhere" file, but "cat inhere" does not work in showing what is inside. 
#Need to find the hidden file. 
#we can do that by ls. then a file called inhere will show. 
#we need to go inside inhere by cd, and then ls -la to look at all the files and their names inside. 
#one file name is .hidden and we can cat .hidden

ls

cat inhere

cd inhere

ls -la

cat .hidden
