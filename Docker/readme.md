What is a container ?
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

Ok, let me make it easy !!!

A container is a bundle of Application, Application libraries required to run your application and the minimum system dependencies.

What is Docker ?
Docker is a containerization platform that provides easy way to containerize your applications, which means, using Docker you can build container images, run the images to create containers and also push these containers to container regestries such as DockerHub, Quay.io and so on.

In simple words, you can understand as containerization is a concept or technology and Docker Implements Containerization.
